# Static Website Component

A serverless component that creates a static website using S3, configures CloudFront (CDN) and maps a custom domain via Route53 (DNS).

## Composition & Dependencies

The Static Website component is composed of some smaller, reusable components, that help build up the functionality.

**Note**: All sub-components will run in parallel unless they are dependent on one or more components. The system automatically determines the dependency graph based on  inputs for components that are outputs of other components.

## State Management

All components manage their own state and stores it in the `state.json` file.

## Operations

The component exposes operations via two commands - `deploy` and `remove`.

### Deploy

```bash
$ components deploy

```

### Remove

```bash
$ components remove

Removing Bucket: 'rgfamily.com'
Removing site: 'rgfamilysite'
Removing Bucket: 'www.rgfamily.com'
Removing Route53 to CloudFront mapping: 'www.rgfamily.com' with id: '/hostedzone/Z3GXWD8T8H34PA'
Route53 Record Set 'www.rgfamily.com => d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net' deletion initiated.
Route53 Hosted Zone '/hostedzone/Z3GXWD8T8H34PA' deletion initiated.
Removing files from Bucket: './site'
Removing CloudFront distribution: 'rgfamilysite' with id: 'E2QSDRLSMYH8WL'
Error in deleting CloudFront distribution 'E2QSDRLSMYH8WL'. The distribution you are trying to delete has not been disabled.
```
**Note**: The component first disables the CloudFront distribution which takes sometime, and hence the subsequent operation of deleting a distribution fails.

But, calling `remove` after a little while successfully deletes the CloudFront configuration.

```bash
$ components remove

Removing CloudFront distribution: 'rgfamilysite' with id: 'E2QSDRLSMYH8WL'
CloudFront distribution 'E2QSDRLSMYH8WL' deletion initiated.
```
